# Zeenoc
Senior Design Project 

Zeenoc is a mobile iOS application that allows tenants to pay rent to their landlord via online payment, while being able to track when their payment deadlines are approaching and also setting up automatic payments. Zeenoc will allow landlords to track the payments on each of their properties, and also those that are behind/early on rent. Zeenoc does not introduce any new legal aspects to the rent paying process, it is a means of transaction while tracking and tabulating the data and providing notifications. The system considers only the encryption of property data at any time and a secure method of transaction. The system should have a fully-fledged user interface for easy access to make payments and view tabulated data.
